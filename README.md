## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

- TikTok
    - I love how TikTok’s algorithm accurately finds content that you will like( This is also a harmful thing because it can make the app very addictive)
    - I also like the logo because it is a nice simple design
- Youtube
    - I like the nostalgia of the logo and the nice bright red
    - I like how I can preview a video by holding onto the thumbnail in the app
- DuoLingo
    - The color and logo are visually pleasing and work perfectly for the app
    - I also love the UI interface. It is very easy to navigate within the app

## Notes

While building this app I struggled a lot with terminology on how to open certain files, such as IBAction and Connections Inspector. To figure out these terms I looked at YouTube videos and the swift handbook.
